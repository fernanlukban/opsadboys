I am rebuilding my blog. My previous blog was built using Gatsby, mainly in
React and hosted on GitHub pages statically. I originally build that website
around 3 years ago, when Gatsby was the new big thing. When looking at
frameworks to rebuild my blog, I wanted to focus on a couple of things:
  - bulid most things myself
  - customization 
  - non-opinionated

When I began fixing up my blog last year, I tried writing some plugins that
would help create some new pages.
